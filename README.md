# TeX Live M (experimental)

TeX Live M is a community effort whose aim is to build a subset of the most important TeX Live packages.

TeX Live currently contains more than hundred thousand files, thousands of packages and takes gigabytes of space.

## Goals

  * Create a "teTeX-like" distribution starting from existing TeX Live infrastructure
  * Maintain a curated database with a complete dependency tree (make change in upstream TL)
  * Reasonably complete to satisfy a large spectrum of users
    (missing packages could still be fetched from the official TL)
  * Allow a minimalistic installation
  * Brainstorm about the best possible schemes

The idea is to start with a slowly growing set of packages where each package
undergoes some quality control before being added to the repository.

It would be helpful to collect statistics from various sources as well as set up some opt-in system to collect it.
We are interested only in requested packages and collections, not in all the installed ones.

This repository is meant for brainstorming.
